								<p>EVENT FAQ &bullet; <a href="#reception">EVENING RECEPTION FAQ</a></p>
								
								<a name="event"></a><h2>EVENT FAQ</h2>
								
								<p><strong>What is the event about?</strong></p>

								<p>This two-day challenge focuses on re-imagining the car shopping experience by bringing together consumers, dealers, manufacturers, designers and technologists to shatter the status quo. In providing this creative, collaborative platform for groups of intellectually diverse thinkers, our goal is to generate a surge of bold and innovative new ideas. A panel of judges will then evaluate the proposed solutions to determine the winners.</p>

								<p><strong>When will the event take place?</strong></p>

								<p>The event spans two days starting on Wednesday, February 27th and ending on Thursday, February 28th, but don&#8217;t miss out on all the fun at the reception the night before - more information on that below.</p>

								<p><strong>Why have this event?</strong></p>

								<p>A car is one of the biggest purchases most consumers will ever make. It remains an unpleasant, anxiety-filled experience that has changed little even with the benefit of online resources. By bringing together the right mix of thought leaders and change agents, we believe we can reinvent the car buying experience from the ground up.</p>

								<p><strong>Why is this a competition?</strong></p>

								<p>We believe that creating an environment where the best ideas are rewarded drives people to perform their best and give their all.</p>

								<p><strong>What are Problem Spaces?</strong></p>

								<p>These are business areas where opportunities for disruption and innovation are aplenty. The Problem Spaces we’ll be exploring are:</p>

								<p><em>Research Experience</em>: How might we provide timely, relevant and meaningful information that people can trust as they shop for a car?</p>

								<p><em>Shopping Experience</em>: How might we help people decide and locate the car they&#8217;ll be happy with?</p>

								<p><em>Retail Experience</em>: How might we create an automotive retail experience people love?</p>

								<p><em>Ownership Experience</em>: How can we keep car owners engaged, informed, and happy about their purchase?</p>

								<p><strong>Why have Problem Spaces?</strong></p>

								<p>Problem Spaces are meant to help frame the conversation and bring focus to the event around real world problems. How will projects come out of Problem Spaces? Participants will get the opportunity to provide, in their own words, Problem Statements that they observe within each Problem Space. After everyone lists their Problem Statements, we&#8217;ll coalesce them into clear and distinct Problem Statements. Each Problem Statement becomes a project.</p>

								<p><strong>How are teams formed?</strong></p>

								<p>Teams are formed as people gravitate toward the Problem Statement they want to solve. A team cannot be more than 6 people.</p>

								<p><strong>What if I don&#8217;t like any of the Problem Statements?</strong></p>

								<p>No problem! Come see any of the event organizers with the Problem Statement you would like to work on and we&#8217;ll add it to the mix.</p>

								<p><strong>Can I come to the event with my own team?</strong></p>

								<p>You can, but it&#8217;s not encouraged. Part of the fun of the event is to work with individuals you haven&#8217;t worked with in the past. The key is that this event will allow you to work with individuals who are as passionate about solving a particular problem as you are, and then you can bring that experience back to your own team in your everyday work.</p>

								<p><strong>Who are the judges?</strong></p>

								<p>The judges&#8217; panel will consist of industry leaders and consumers who have the acumen to discern solutions that have the best chance of reinventing the car shopping experience.</p>

								<p><strong>What are the judging criteria?</strong></p>

								<p>The judges will evaluate the proposed solutions based on the following criteria:</p>

								<ol>
								<li><p>Originality of idea</p></li>
								<li><p>Feasibility of implementation</p></li>
								<li><p>Likelihood of adoption</p></li>
								<li><p>Fidelity of prototype</p></li>
								<li><p>Level of authenticity and transparency</p></li>
								<li><p>Business impact</p></li>
								<li><p>Storytelling</p></li>
								</ol>

								<p><strong>What will the winning teams get?</strong></p>

								<p>We have exciting prizes for the winner and the two runner-ups.</p>

								<p>1st Place: $10,000 cash prize.</p>

								<p>2nd Place: $5,000 cash prize.</p>

								<p>3rd Place: $3,000 cash prize.</p>

								<p>Edmunds will distribute the cash prize equally among the winning team members.</p>

								<p><strong>Why would I want to participate in this event?</strong></p>

								<p>Buying a car remains an unpleasant, anxiety-filled experience that has changed little even with the advent of technology. This special event brings together thought leaders and change agents from all over the country to brainstorm innovative solutions for this persistent problem. As a participant in this event, you will get to put forth solutions that could greatly impact d the future of car shopping.</p>

								<p><strong>How will teams present their ideas to the judges?</strong></p>

								<p>Your project needs to have a prototype of some sort. The prototype could be software, keynote presentation, paper prototype, a comedy skit, …etc. As long as we get to fully understand what your project does and how it addresses the particular problem you set out to solve, then you’re good.</p>

								<p><strong>What do we need to bring to the event?</strong></p>

								<p>Bring your laptop and charger. Most importantly, bring a great deal of enthusiasm, passion and open mindedness. Put on your pirate hat and start disrupting!</p>
								
								<p><strong>What happens to the ideas created at the event?</strong></p>

								<p>In order to create a collaborative and open environment where innovation is possible, all ideas, concepts, feedback, content or suggestions submitted, conceived, or created at the event will be deemed public disclosures and open source materials and will be made available on this website.</p>
								
								<p><strong>Can I bring someone along? if so, do they have to register for the event or can they just show up?</strong></p>

								<p>Of course, everyone is welcomed! We hope to have people with a variety of skills join us. This will only make for a much more successful hackathon. However, please have them register for the event. Space is going to be limited and we want to make sure we can fit everyone in who truly wants to participate.</p>
								
								<p><strong>Will there be investors at the event?</strong></p>
